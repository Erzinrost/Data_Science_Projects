<br><br>
So many people all around the globe are using various mobile apps. Why not to explore what app profiles are of the most popularity and to think about developing such an app?
<br><br>
We use a representative dataset on apps from App Store and Google Play to find possible answers to this question. At the end of the analysis we come up with a recommendation to build an app around a popular book, or a series of such books.

## Project 2 - How to Promote Your Great Idea?

<br><br>
Let's suppose you have a great idea, which can be realized only with the help of other. What should you do, how can you promote it?
<br><br>
To answer these questions we explore the data from the Hacker News website, which is prominent among investors and members of the start-up community in general. At the end we conclude that posting around midday or a bit later may increase your chances to get noticed there.

## Project 3 - What Are the Car Models to Make Business with?

<br><br>
The market of automobiles is immense in its size, and those who know the trends and its underlying structure might take great advantage of this knowledge and earn lots of money. What are the car models sold the most, what are their prices and other major characteristics?
<br><br>
To give an advice to car dealers and other potential stakeholders, especially those operating in Germany, we introduce a dataset on sold cars in the classfield section of the German eBay website. We conculde that such car models as Volkswagen Golf, BMW 3 Series, Opel Corsa, Opel Astra, Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Audi A4, Ford Focus and Ford Fiesta were sold the most in Spring 2016. Moreover, the cheaper models are usually sold faster one day on average, while the price of premium brands is seemingly not affected much by the higher average mileage.

## Project 4 - What Determines the Choice of a College Major?

<br><br>
Choosing a college major is one of the most important decisions individuals do during their lifetime, therefore it is an imperative to do it wisely. What criteria should be referred to and are prospective earnings a decisive factor, when others do this choice?
<br><br>
To make the link between education and possible career prospects clearer, we explore American Community Survey 2010-2012 Public Use Microdata Series, which contains data on various college majors' median earnings, number of males and females, unemployment, etc. At the end of our investigation, we conclude that Engineering is the most promising field in terms of earnings, but Psychology, Humanities and Social Sciences are nonetheless more popular. Moreover, we found out significant differences in college major choices made by males and females.

## Project 5 - Where Do Best Students Come From?

<br><br>
Secondary education is an important stepping stone into the bright future and doing well on this stage allows being enrolled into the best colleges and universities. What factors are important the most for a student to perform academically well and get good final test scores? What are the major impediments?
<br><br>
To explore these issues we use the data on New York public schools and the 2012 SAT results, which is the major test for college admissions. We conclude that motivated students surrounded with Asian socio-cultural background, fluent in English, from richer families, with solid previous background and taught by well-paid teachers are likely to perform the best on standardized tests like SAT. Nonetheless, we assert the limitations of such tests in measuring individual potential, which rather quantify the ability to solve fast within a certain time frame. Moreover, we indicate the repercussions of disparities in academic performance, originating from socio-cultural and income differences, which harm the whole society.

## Project 6 - Will the Chinese Currency Become Truly Global?
*Language - Python*<br><br>

<br><br>
The phenomenon of currencies' global popularity has always been a topic of great interest to researchers, policy makers and the general public, since countries with highly internationalized currencies gain much power over the world financial markets and may dictate their will. Since recently, the debates over the possible perspectives of the Chinese yuan on the international markets have intensified, as China gained so much economic weight in the world and has already outreached the US in terms of GDP PPP. However, will this currency be able to challenge the US dollar dominant position in the near future? What factors may facilitate and what may impede the rise of currencies' global popularity in general?
<br><br>
To answer these questions we introduce a currencies' internationalization index based on their respective shares on major international markets and try to explain it by GDP, financial markets development and capital controls historical dynamics, as well as by network externalities and lock-in effects. At the end of our analysis we conclude that it takes much time for currencies to become truly global and the incumbent position of the dominant ones can hardly to be challenged by underdogs primarily due to the high historical inertia of the internationalization process itself. Nonetheless, according to our forecasts, the Chinese yuan is likely to close the distance with the British pound and the Japanese yen by the end of the upcoming decade, mainly thanks to its accumulated economic power.

## Project 7 - What Is the Optimal Strategy for a Media Store?
*Language - SQL*<br><br>
*N.B. For the correct view please check the following link* - [Jupyter nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erzinrost/Data_Science_Projects/blob/master/Project%207%20-%20What%20Is%20the%20Optimal%20Strategy%20for%20a%20Media%20Store_.ipynb)
<br><br>
Digital media market is a huge one, with various products available and immense customer demand, thus promising lucrative sales to dexterous intermediaries, i.e. digital media stores. What are those marketable customers' preferences to leverage on? Which media products, artists and music bands are sold the most and which are less likely to perform well on the market? What other product traits might be of importance to maximize sales?
<br><br> 
To provide with answers to the above-mentioned questions we introduce and explore the Chinook dataset containing data on sales, employees, customers and other related data. At the end of our analysis we conclude that purchasing decisions should be based on the track-by-track or album-by-album basis, rather than corresponding artists/bands popularity, unprotected media products from Rock, Alternative & Punk and Metal genres are most likely to enjoy much of customers' demand, and salesmen experience is an important factor in the revenue-generating process to be considered. Popular bands almost surely guaranteeing good sales record with no tracks unsold according to our empirics are Red Hot Chili Peppers, Queen and Guns N' Roses - therefore digital media stores should consider them first when making their purchasing decisions.
