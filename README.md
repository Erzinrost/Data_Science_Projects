## Project 1 - What Is an App Profile to Hit the Jackpot with?
So many people all around the globe are using various mobile apps. Why not to explore what app profiles are of the most popularity and to think about developing such an app?
<br>
We use a representative dataset on apps from App Store and Google Play to find possible answers to this question. At the end of the analysis we come up with a recommendation to build an app around a popular book, or a series of such books.

## Project 2 - How to Promote Your Great Idea?
Let's suppose you have a great idea, which can be realized only with the help of other. What should you do, how can you promote it?
<br>
To answer these questions we explore the data from the Hacker News website, which is prominent among investors and members of the start-up community in general. At the end we conclude that posting around midday or a bit later may increase your chances to get noticed there.

## Project 3 - What Are the Car Models to Make Business with?
The market of automobiles is immense in its size, and those who know the trends and its underlying structure might take great advantage of this knowledge and earn lots of money. What are the car models sold the most, what are their prices and other major characteristics?
<br>
To give an advice to car dealers and other potential stakeholders, especially those operating in Germany, we introduce a dataset on sold cars in the classfield section of the German eBay website. We conculde that such car models as Volkswagen Golf, BMW 3 Series, Opel Corsa, Opel Astra, Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Audi A4, Ford Focus and Ford Fiesta were sold the most in Spring 2016. Moreover, the cheaper models are usually sold faster one day on average, while the price of premium brands is seemingly not affected much by the higher average mileage.
