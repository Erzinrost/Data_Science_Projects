    "- The **major aim** of this project is to determine what is the best way to post information about a project, idea, or get competent feedback and valuable insights. Besides the very essence of the post, the **timing might be considered as an importnat factor**, and for that reason **show posts** along with other types of posts on the popular Hacker News website are investigated with respect to the number of comments received and the amount of upvotes given.\n",
    "- The **dataset** covers Hacker News posts, where user-submitted stories and questions are voted and commented upon. The original dataset is taken from Kaggle and is openly available. Considering the fact that today there are around five million users there, and [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-silicon-valley/the-lonely-work-of-moderating-hacker-news#:~:text=Today%2C%20around%20five%20million%20people,grown%20more%20difficult%20to%20moderate.) claims that \"landing a blog post or personal project on the front page is a badge of honor for many technologists\" or \"the site is now a portal to tech culture for millions of people\", it would have been a valuable insight to know how to make a popular post on Hacker News and draw attention of others, including prominent investors like Y Combinator.\n",
    "- The **final result** of the investigation might serve well to those either looking to promote their ideas or seeking for competent answers in the tech field as to how to increase their odds of getting that. Our answer is that one may do that on the Hacker News website, and the best timing to publish a post is **around midday** or a bit later - up to 15:00 (Eastern Time in the US)."

    "The [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) website was launched as a side project on February 19, 2007 by Paul Graham's investment fund and startup incubator, Y Combinator. The original intent was to build a community around a social news website with the spirit of intellectual curiosity. Its focus is on computer science and tech entrepreneurship. The content is actively moderated, so that not to allow spam and misconduct to be the case there. The users cannot downvote comments up until they have accumulated enough \"karma points\", which is calculated as the 501 point difference between their own content's upvotes and downvotes."
