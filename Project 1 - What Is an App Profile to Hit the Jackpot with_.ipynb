    "- This project is about figuring out what mobile app profiles or genres in App Store and Google Play are **most promising** and which are not. The task is done by the assessement of competitive landscape within each genre - i.e. types of major players, degree of market concentration, etc.\n",
    "- The datasets used do not cover all apps, but are rather samples with enough observations to be representative of the whole population. The [initial Google Play dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) contains 10841 values, while the [initial App Store dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) - 7197 values.\n",
    "- The final goal is to provide app developers and others concerned with the insights regarding what niches to concentrate efforts on and what segments to stay away from. At the end of the project we propose to design a specialised free **app for reading** with special features - either containing the greatest books of all time or religious texts."

    "Despite its average user rating, among iOS apps Facebook has almost 40% of all ratings given to apps in Social Networking genre, its closest rival, - Pininterest, - has only 14%, and all the others' share is way smaller compared to the former. A more fragmented competitive landscape can be observed in Google Play Store - in both genres, which roughly correspond to Social Networking genre in Apple Store there are several leaders besides Facebook, many of which are Google products. Nevertheless, even here we may see that top five apps are installed in nearly 50% of cases, which implies high market concentration and the market power of those apps affiliated with Google and Apple. Moreover, the market for the social communication genre seems to be already saturated, as there are over 100 apps in Apple Store and more than 500 apps in Google Play Store, satisfying various demands in this market. All in all, it is **not recommended** to develop a new app in this category - the risks of failure to gain users and certain market share are very high.\n",

    "A similar picture is observed in the Books & Reference genre for Android apps, where Google Play Books has 60% of installs and Book genre for iOS apps, where Kindle with its average user rating clearly dominates with 45% of times being rated within the category. At the same time, the smaller number of apps in Apple Store, - 29 vs. 189 in Google Play Store, - can be probably explained by the presence of Apple Books app available for iOS users. All in all, universal products of Apple and Google dominate the competitive landscape here.\n",

    "Nonethess, in the Reference genre of iOS apps we may see that there is one dominating app - **Bible** (also the third most popular app installed in Android smart phones - 6% of total installments within category). It has been rated 73% of times in this genre, while the total amount of apps is only 17 - this niche is likely **not saturated** yet. In addition, there are other apps in this category, which are designed for specific books or games - Quran and Minecraft. The fact that the app for using **Bible stands out** so much is revealing - it could be a good idea to develop a similar app geared to just one book or game. We would recommend to consider such options as an app allowing to read the [world greatest books](https://thegreatestbooks.org/) with some features, like cards with crititcal reviews, brief summaries, etc., or an app for reading religious text and prayers aimed at a specific religion like Buddhists, Judaists, etc. "
